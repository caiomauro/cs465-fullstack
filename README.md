**Frontend Development in Full Stack Project**

In our full stack project, we utilized various frontend technologies including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Initially, the customer-facing site was built with static Express HTML but was later optimized using Handlebars (.hbs) views for faster rendering by avoiding full page reloads. While HTML is static and client-facing, it cannot interact with backend databases. JavaScript, used both on the frontend and backend, added dynamic elements by pulling data from the MongoDB database, allowing the page to update based on user interactions. SPAs provided a smoother, app-like experience without full page reloads.

**Backend Development with MongoDB**

We chose a NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend due to its flexibility in modifying schemas to adapt to changing requirements and its ability to scale horizontally. MongoDB's non-relational structure made it suitable for our needs, ensuring efficient data management and scalability.

**Integration of JSON and JavaScript**

JSON, a standardized data format, differs from JavaScript in that it represents data in a text format that can easily be converted into JavaScript objects. This facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend, allowing data to be stored once and utilized in various ways based on frontend requests. 

**Code Refactoring and UI Components**

An example of refactoring for improved functionality and efficiency was consolidating trip card and trip list components into reusable UI elements. Reusing UI components streamlines development, reduces application size, and minimizes the risk of errors and security vulnerabilities.

**API Testing and Security**

API testing involved methods such as accessing the localhost API endpoint directly and using tools like Postman for more comprehensive testing, including security measures. Understanding methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), endpoints, and security is crucial for maintaining a functional and secure full stack application. Ensuring endpoints work correctly and are protected from unauthorized access is vital for database integrity.

**Course Reflection**

This course has significantly advanced my professional development by helping me identify my career direction in full stack development. Balancing full-time work and school, I've gained insights into my interests in front or backend development. Key skills acquired include understanding how different code modules integrate to create a finished product, making me a more competitive candidate in the job market.
